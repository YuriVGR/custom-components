# The idea

This is where I will post every component I made on every project, it will probably take some time before I give this project some love but it will be ok!!!!

## For now
First I will focus on developing any idea that comes towards me, that includes:
- urRead (A reader, the name says it all, built on React Native, may be ported to something else when I try to learn anything apart from typescript)
- My Portifolio (This is... a portifolio ? Well, it will include dynamic pages and 4/5 kind of components, so there's content!!!)
- Poke NextWind (A pokedex built on NextJS and Tailwind, and yes, I know that EVERY front end developer built one at some point)

# And!!!!

That's it for now O.o
